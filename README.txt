Introduction

A partition of n is a representation of this number as a sum of positive integers: n=n1+n2+...+nr such that n1≥n2≥...≥nr. The numbers n1,n2,...,nr are called parts.

The partition 19=5+3+3+2+2+2+2 can be written as 53224, while 19=5+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 can be written as 527.
Hence the upper indices are 124 and 107, thus 5+3+3+2+2+2+2 is larger than 5+2+2+2+2+2+2+2,
since 124 is larger than 107.


Problem

Starting from the smallest partition, write all partitions of the integer n, which parts are prime numbers and the largest part is equal to k. n can be stored in byte.

Input

In the first line: a number of the rest lines
Then, separated by spaces: n and k

Output

Partitions separated by +. If there is no partition, then write nothing.
